## The Pigeonhole principle

### Dividing the difference

> Given $$n + 1$$ integers, there exists a pair $$a, b$$ such that $$n$$ divides $$a-b$$.


### Summing to 10

> For every 6-element subset $$S$$ of $$\{ 1, \dots, 9 \}$$, there exists a pair of distinct integers $$a, b \in S$$ such that $$a + b = 10$$.


### We have the same number of friends!

> Is it possible that at a party all guests have different numbers of friends attending?


### The Friendship Theorem

> Given a group of six people, show that there always exist three such that either
> * all know each other, or
> * none of them are acquaintances.


### The square orchard

> You own a small orchard containing 51 trees. The shape of the garden is a square with side length 70 meters. It is possible to use a circular fence of radius 10 meters to enclose at least 3 of the trees?
