## Symmetry

### Calendar dice

> You are planning to order two custom-made dice so they can show the current day of the month (01 to 31). Each face can be engraved with a single digit. You want to use both dice every day, but the order in which you arrange them doesn't matter. Is this possible? If so, provide a sample arrangement of the faces.


### A simple card game

> Someone stops you on the street asking to play the following game. You start with a standard shuffled deck of 52 cards, and take two cards at a time. If both cards are red, they go to your pile. If both cards are black, they go to the opponent's pile. If the cards have different colors, they are discarded. Once the deck is exhausted, the game ends. If you have more cards in your pile, you win $100, and otherwise you don't get anything.
> 
> How much are you willing to pay for the game?


### Apples and oranges

> A stall at the farmer's market sells three products: boxes of apples, boxes of oranges, and a mix of the two. All boxes are fully opaque and mislabeled. The seller offers his customers a discount if they can guess the the contents of all boxes by opening a minimal number of them. What is this number, and how can one get the discount?
> 
> Imagine that the seller becomes more strict with his discount policy. He has redefined ``opening'' a box to mean reaching in and picking a single piece of fruit. How does the problem change?


### Separating coins

> There is a room with 100 coins on the floor, 10 of them are heads up, and the remaining are tails up. If you enter blindfolded, can you produce two piles such that the number of heads up coins in each is equal.
> 
> Assume you cannot distinguish the two sides of a coin by touching it, but you are allowed to turn coins.
