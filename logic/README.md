# Logic

### Racing horses

> Imagine we have 25 horses and a track with 5 lanes. What is the minimum number of races necessary to find the top three horses?
> 
> You can assume all horses perform consistently (e.g., they run at a constant speed which does not vary between races).


### Infinite exponentiation

> If
> $$
> x^{x^{x^\cdots}} = 2,
> $$
> what is the value of $$x$$?


### Renaissance security

> Leodardo da Vinci would like to send a private message to his close friend Niccol\`o Macchiavelli. The messenger they use can deliver a box from one location to the other. Unfortunately, the service is not secure so anything they place in an unlocked box will be seen, copied, or worse, lost. How can they exchange the message securely?


### The average offer

> A number of Harvard seniors plan to meet and celebrate their job offers. Being naturally curious, they would like to know the average salary in the group. On the other hand, no single student would like to disclose his offer to anyone else. How can they learn the group average?
