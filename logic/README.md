## Notes 1


### A magic island

> Once upon a time, there was a magic island on which a hundred smart and rational tigers lived. Even though the tigers did not like eating the local vegetation, they were not cannibals either, so that was their diet.
>
> One day a sheep appeared on the island. Every tiger wanted to eat it, and the sheep was exactly the size of a tiger's meal. As the most blood-thirsty beast approached the sheep, it said ''Be careful. Remember there is magic in the air. If one eats a sheep, they will also become a sheep immediately.''
>
>How does the story end?


### Racing horses

> Imagine we have 25 horses and a track with 5 lanes. What is the minimum number of races necessary to find the top three horses?
> 
> You can assume all horses perform consistently (e.g., they run at a constant speed which does not vary between races).


### Kill Bill

> A thousand samurai, numbered 1 to 1000, are standing in a circle. The first one takes his sword and kills the second. Then, the next man in the circle, number 3, kills number 4. The process continues until there is only one samurai standing. What is his number?


### Covering with dominoes

> We are given a $$8 \times 8$$ board with two diagonal corners missing. Is it possible to cover it completely with dominoes without any pieces overlapping.
> 
> Assume the board and domino squares are of the same size.


### Packing bricks

> Is it possible to fit 53 bricks of size $$1 \times 1 \times 4$$ into a $$6 \times 6 \times 6$$ box?


## Notes 2


### Infinite exponentiation

> If
> $$
> x^{x^{x^\cdots}} = 2,
> $$
> what is the value of $$x$$?


### Calendar dice

> You are planning to order two custom-made dice so they can show the current day of the month (01 to 31). Each face can be engraved with a single digit. You want to use both dice every day, but the order in which you arrange them doesn't matter. Is this possible? If so, provide a sample arrangement of the faces.


### A simple card game

> Someone stops you on the street asking to play the following game. You start with a standard shuffled deck of 52 cards, and take two cards at a time. If both cards are red, they go to your pile. If both cards are black, they go to the opponent's pile. If the cards have different colors, they are discarded. Once the deck is exhausted, the game ends. If you have more cards in your pile, you win $100, and otherwise you don't get anything.
> 
> How much are you willing to pay for the game?


### Apples and oranges

> A stall at the farmer's market sells three products: boxes of apples, boxes of oranges, and a mix of the two. All boxes are fully opaque and mislabeled. The seller offers his customers a discount if they can guess the the contents of all boxes by opening a minimal number of them. What is this number, and how can one get the discount?
> 
> Imagine that the seller becomes more strict with his discount policy. He has redefined ``opening'' a box to mean reaching in and picking a single piece of fruit. How does the problem change?


### Separating coins

> There is a room with 100 coins on the floor, 10 of them are heads up, and the remaining are tails up. If you enter blindfolded, can you produce two piles such that the number of heads up coins in each is equal.
> 
> Assume you cannot distinguish the two sides of a coin by touching it, but you are allowed to turn coins.


### The boss's birthday

> Alice, a manager at Big-Name-Firm Inc, thought of a riddle to give her colleagues Bryan and Claire. She told them that her birthday is on one of the following dates.
> 
>     March 4, March 5, March 8
> 
>     June 4, June 7
> 
>     September 1, September 5
> 
>     December 1, December 2, December 8
> 
> Alice also told the Bryan the month of her birthday, and Claire the day. Later on, the following conversation took place.
> 
>     Bryan: I don't know Alice's Birthday, but you don't know it either.
> 
>     Claire: I didn't know her birthday initially, but now I do.
> 
>     Bryan: Now I know it too.
> 
> What is Alice's birthday?


## Notes 3


### Democratic pirates

> Ten democratic pirates looted 100 gold coins. Seeing that they need to divide the treasure, they agreed on the following method.
> 
> First, the most senior pirate proposes a distribution. All pirates, including the most senior one, proceed to vote. If at least half of them accept distribution, the loot is divided as proposed. If not, the most senor pirate will be thrown overboard. The process continues with the next most senior pirate, and so on.
> 
> Assume the pirates are rational: they prefer to stay alive first, and earn more gold second. Also, given two otherwise equal outcomes, they prefer to have fewer pirates on the ship.
> 
> How will the pirates divide the gold?


### Renaissance security

> Leodardo da Vinci would like to send a private message to his close friend Niccol\`o Macchiavelli. The messenger they use can deliver a box from one location to the other. Unfortunately, the service is not secure so anything they place in an unlocked box will be seen, copied, or worse, lost. How can they exchange the message securely?


### The average offer

> A number of Harvard seniors plan to meet and celebrate their job offers. Being naturally curious, they would like to know the average salary in the group. On the other hand, no single student would like to disclose his offer to anyone else. How can they learn the group average?


### Dividing the difference

> Given $$n + 1$$ integers, there exists a pair $$a, b$$ such that $$n$$ divides $$a-b$$.


### Summing to 10

> For every 6-element subset $$S$$ of $$\{ 1, \dots, 9 \}$$, there exists a pair of distinct integers $$a, b \in S$$ such that $$a + b = 10$$.


### We have the same number of friends!

> Is it possible that at a party all guests have different numbers of friends attending?


### The Friendship Theorem

> Given a group of six people, show that there always exist three such that either
> * all know each other, or
> * none of them are acquaintances.


### The square orchard

> You own a small orchard containing 51 trees. The shape of the garden is a square with side length 70 meters. It is possible to use a circular fence of radius 10 meters to enclose at least 3 of the trees?
