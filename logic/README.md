### Racing horses

> Imagine we have 25 horses and a track with 5 lanes. What is the minimum number of races necessary to find the top three horses?
> 
> You can assume all horses perform consistently (e.g., they run at a constant speed which does not vary between races).


### Infinite exponentiation

> If
> $$
> x^{x^{x^\cdots}} = 2,
> $$
> what is the value of $$x$$?


### Renaissance security

> Leodardo da Vinci would like to send a private message to his close friend Niccol\`o Macchiavelli. The messenger they use can deliver a box from one location to the other. Unfortunately, the service is not secure so anything they place in an unlocked box will be seen, copied, or worse, lost. How can they exchange the message securely?

In this problem it is very important to have the right out-of-the-box idea, that in this case is the fact that there might be more than one shipping involved, the package can go back and forth a few times. In particular, the first step is Leonardo sending a box containing his message, locked with a lock he owns the key of. Then, Machiavelli just adds a locker to the box, a locker he owns the key of, and send it back to Leonardo. Finally, Leonardo removes his locker from the box and sends it back to Machiavelli. In this way, at the very end Machiavelli gets the box, locked only with a locker for which he owns the key, so that he can open it and read the message.

### The average offer

> A number of Harvard seniors plan to meet and celebrate their job offers. Being naturally curious, they would like to know the average salary in the group. On the other hand, no single student would like to disclose his offer to anyone else. How can they learn the group average?
