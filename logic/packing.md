## Packing and covering

### Covering with dominoes

> We are given a $$8 \times 8$$ board with two diagonal corners missing. Is it possible to cover it completely with dominoes without any pieces overlapping.
> 
> Assume the board and domino squares are of the same size.


### Packing bricks

> Is it possible to fit 53 bricks of size $$1 \times 1 \times 4$$ into a $$6 \times 6 \times 6$$ box?
