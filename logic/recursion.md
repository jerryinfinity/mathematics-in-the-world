## Recursive reasoning

### A magic island

> Once upon a time, there was a magic island on which a hundred smart and rational tigers lived. Even though the tigers did not like eating the local vegetation, they were not cannibals either, so that was their diet.
>
> One day a sheep appeared on the island. Every tiger wanted to eat it, and the sheep was exactly the size of a tiger's meal. As the most blood-thirsty beast approached the sheep, it said ''Be careful. Remember there is magic in the air. If one eats a sheep, they will also become a sheep immediately.''

>How does the story end?


### Democratic pirates

> Ten democratic pirates looted 100 gold coins. Seeing that they need to divide the treasure, they agreed on the following method.
> 
> First, the most senior pirate proposes a distribution. All pirates, including the most senior one, proceed to vote. If at least half of them accept distribution, the loot is divided as proposed. If not, the most senor pirate will be thrown overboard. The process continues with the next most senior pirate, and so on.
> 
> Assume the pirates are rational: they prefer to stay alive first, and earn more gold second. Also, given two otherwise equal outcomes, they prefer to have fewer pirates on the ship.
> 
> How will the pirates divide the gold?


### Kill Bill

> A thousand samurai, numbered 1 to 1000, are standing in a circle. The first one takes his sword and kills the second. Then, the next man in the circle, number 3, kills number 4. The process continues until there is only one samurai standing. What is his number?
